# GitHub workflows

## Reusable workflows

This folder contains some workflows that can be re-used from other repositories:

- [`publish-techdocs`](./publish-techdocs.md): Publish your project's
  documentation to EngHub

- [`reusable-zizmor`](./reusable-zizmor.md): Run [zizmor] static analysis on
  your GitHub Actions workflow files.
