# docker-build-push-multiarch

This is a reusable workflow that uses Grafana's hosted runners to natively build and push multi-architecture docker
images.

Right now this supports pushing images to:

- Google Artifact Registry
- DockerHub

And supports building the following image types:

- linux/arm64
- linux/amd64

## How it works

This generates a matrix based off of the `platforms` input, then creates a job per platform that runs the composite
actions [docker-build-push-image] and [docker-export-digest] to build and push docker images, and capture their digests.
There is then a final job that runs the composite action [docker-import-digests-push-manifest] to push the docker
manifest.
