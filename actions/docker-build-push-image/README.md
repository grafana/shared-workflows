# docker-build-push-image

This is a composite GitHub Action, used to build and push docker images to private Grafana registries.
It builds registry URLs for Grafana's registries, authenticates to them, and then
uses [docker/build-push-action] to build and push the image(s).

This action can work 1 of 2 ways:

1. It can be run on a single runner, and if multiple `platforms` are configured then buildx/QEMU emulation is used.
2. It can be used in conjunction with [docker-export-digest] and [docker-import-digests-push-manifest] to push untagged
   images whose digests are later exported and merged into a tagged docker manifest. For true multi-arch builds.

This can push to the following registries:

1. Google Artifact Registry
2. DockerHub

## How we construct Google Artifact Registry Images

The full GAR image is constructed as follows, where `gar-project` is determined by `inputs.gar-environment`.

"${{ inputs.gar-registry }}/${{ gar-project }}/${{ inputs.gar-repository }}/${{ inputs.gar-image }}"

## How we construct DockerHub Images

The full DockerHub image is constructed as follows:

"${{ inputs.dockerhub-registry }}/${{ inputs.dockerhub-repository }}"

## Adding New Registries

Each registry is setup as follows:

- All inputs for a registry share the same prefix (ex: `gar-image`, `gar-repository`).
- Inputs that are used for a specific registry are _not_ required by the workflow. Instead, validation is done in a step
  specific to that registry.
- To calculate which registries have been configured, we loop through `inputs.registries`, and for each registry
  configured we set the outputs `include-<registry>`. Those flags can be used to create steps that only execute when X
  registry is configured.
- Each registry has a Setup step. This step takes the inputs specific to that registry and generates an untagged,
  `image` name for that specific registry.
- The `setup-vars` step then loops through each configured image and creates a full list of images to push.
- That's it! That list of images to push is fed to `docker/build-push-action` along with the configured tags, and each
  tagged image is pushed to each registry.

So then the full checklist of work to do to implement a new registry is:

- [ ] Add (and document) any inputs that you need to capture. Use the same prefix for all inputs, and all inputs must
      _not_ be required.
- [ ] Add a step before `setup-vars` that takes those input values and constructs a valid untagged image name for the
      registry you'll be pushing to. Then set that as an output.
      Ex: `echo "image=${DOCKERHUB_REGISTRY}/${DOCKERHUB_IMAGE}" | tee -a "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"`
- [ ] Add your image into the `setup-vars` step by passing the output image into an env variable, and adding it to the
      list of images to be parsed. Use the existing repos as examples.
- [ ] Add a login step that depends
      on `${{ inputs.push == 'true' && steps.registries.outputs.include-<yourRegistry> == 'true' }}`, where yourRegistry is
      the value that will be passed into the `registries` input. Again, use existing repos as examples.
