# login-to-gar

This is a composite GitHub Action, used to login to Google Artifact Registry (GAR).
It uses [OIDC authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
which means that only workflows which get triggered based on certain rules can trigger these composite workflows.

| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                             | Default             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `registry`                | Google Artifact Registry to authenticate against.                                                                                       | `us-docker.pkg.dev` |
| `delete_credentials_file` | Delete the credentials file after the action is finished. If you want to keep the credentials file for a later step, set this to false. | `false`             |

> [!WARNING]
> When using the `login-to-gar` action in GitHub Actions workflows, always place the `checkout` action before it. This is because the `login-to-gar` action stores Docker credentials in the workspace, and these credentials would be lost if the workspace is overwritten by a subsequent `checkout` action. The correct order makes sure that the Docker credentials persist throughout the workflow.
