# login-to-gar

This is a composite GitHub Action, used to login to Google Artifact Registry
(GAR). It uses [OIDC authentication], which means that only workflows which get
triggered based on certain rules can trigger these composite workflows.

[Docker Actions Compatibility]: #docker-actions-compatibility

## Docker Actions Compatibility

By default, this action stores credentials in a temporary location outside of
your workspace to prevent accidental commits or exposure. This is a
security-first approach that deviates from the upstream
`google-github-actions/auth` action's default behavior.

The upstream action places credentials in the workspace by design to ensure
Docker-based GitHub Actions work transparently. However, this comes with
significant security risks: active credentials in the working directory can be
easily accidentally printed in logs or committed to repositories,

If you need to use Docker-based GitHub Actions that require workspace access to
credentials files, set `workspace_credentials: true`.

> [!CAUTION]
> When using `workspace_credentials: true`:
>
> 1. [Always place the `checkout` action before `login-to-gar` to prevent
>    credentials from being overwritten][checkout-before-login].
> 2. Add `gha-creds-*.json` to your `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files to
>    prevent accidentally committing credentials
> 3. Be extra careful with any steps that commit changes, as they may
>    inadvertently include credential files
