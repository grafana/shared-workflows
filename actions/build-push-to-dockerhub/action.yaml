    # The `context` input is flagged by Zizmor as a [sink]. This means that with
    # the upstream action the user's input to the input ends up in an output,
    # and so if it's not handled properly, it could lead to a template injection
    # attack. In this action, we pass through the inputs, but we don't then pass
    # back the outputs, so we should be fine. Even if we did pass back the
    # outputs, we consider ourselves a proxy, so in that case our job would be
    # to warn users but not to take any action.
