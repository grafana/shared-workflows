# push-to-gcs

This is a composite GitHub Action, used to push objects to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
It uses [OIDC authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
which means that only workflows which get triggered based on certain rules can
trigger these composite workflows.
